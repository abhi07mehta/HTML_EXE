<h2>Now let's take a bit closer look at main stream versions</h2>

<h3>HTML 1.0</h3>
<p>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</p>
<h3>HTML 2.0</h3>
<p>Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features, which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</p>
<h3>HTML 3.0</h3>
<p>Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
</p>
<h3>HTML 4.0</h3>
<p>Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.
</p>
<h3>HTML 5.0</h3>
<p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.</p>
